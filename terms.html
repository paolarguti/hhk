<p>For Jurisdictions that do not allow us to limit our liability: Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law.

<h4 class="mb2">14. Choice of Law</h4>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the State of Maryland. The offer and acceptance of this contract are deemed to have occurred in the State of Maryland.</p>

<h4 class="mb2">15. Forum of Dispute</h4>
<p>You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be heard solely by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Maryland. Specifically, where the subject matter of a dispute is eligible for it, you agree that any disputes shall be heard solely within the District Court of the State of Maryland (“Small Claims Court”) in accordance with Title 3 of the Maryland Rules ("Civil Procedure - District Court") as well as all other applicable law.</p>
<p>If a dispute claims multiple claims and one or more of those claims would be eligible to be heard by the Small Claims Court, you agree not to bring the other claims against us and to instead proceed within the Small Claims Court.</p>
<p>If you would be entitled in a dispute to an amount exceeding the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, you agree to waive your right to collect any damages in excess of the monetary jurisdiction and instead still bring your claim within the Small Claims Court. At the time of the drafting of this Agreement, the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court is $5,000.</p>
<p>You agree that if a dispute is eligible to be heard in Small Claims Court but you would be entitled to an additional or alternative remedy in a higher court, such as injunctive relief, you will waive your right to that remedy and still bring the dispute within the Small Claims Court.</p>
<p>If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements in doing so.

<h4 class="mb2">16. Force Majeure</h4>
<p>You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), embargoes, postal disruption, communication disruption, unavailability of payment processors, failure or shortage of infrastructure, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.</p>

<h4 class="mb2">17. Severability</h4>
<p>In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, conflicting with another provision of the Agreement, or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unenforceable provision being included in it.
If two or more provisions of this Agreement are deemed to conflict with each other’s operation, Hometown Harvest Kitchen shall have the sole right to elect which provision remains in force.</p>

<h4 class="mb2">18. Non-Waiver</h4>
<p>Hometown Harvest Kitchen reserves all rights afforded to us under this Agreement as well as under the provisions of any applicable law. Our non-enforcement of any particular provision or provisions of this Agreement or any applicable law should not be construed as our waiver of the right to enforce that same provision under the same or different circumstances at any time in the future.</p>

<h4 class="mb2">20. Assignment of Rights</h4>
<p>You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any other party at our discretion.</p>
